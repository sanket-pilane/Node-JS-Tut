🚀 Just Deployed: Contact Management System - A Fully Secured REST API 🔐
Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, this project showcases how authentication, authorization, and CRUD operations come together to create a scalable backend system.

📌 What It Does:
A simple, modular, and production-ready Contact Management System that allows users to securely manage their personal contact data.
It includes:

🔐 User Registration & Login (passwords hashed with bcrypt)

🗝️ JWT Authentication (access token required for all contact routes)

📒 Full CRUD Operations for contacts (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

🧱 Centralized Error Handling for consistent and clean API responses

🐳 Docker Support for containerized deployment

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Node.js • Express.js • MongoDB (Mongoose) • JWT • bcrypt • Postman • Docker • Git & GitHub

💡 Why This Project?
While learning Node.js deeply, I wanted to go beyond boilerplate apps. I built this project to get hands-on with:

🔐 Real-world JWT authentication and session control

🔄 Secure, scoped access to user-specific data

⚙️ Centralized middleware & modular file structure

🚀 Dockerizing backend apps for portability and deployment
